# This is the uSDaemon. It is a little daemon used to automatically discover
# the uSD card presence in the on-board reader. The default configuration of
# this daemon *only* look for the specific USB-uSD-reader that is welded at
# the USB geographical address '1-1.4:1.0'. The user can change the
# evironment variable 'USBDEVICE' to work with another address. The daemon
# is limited in this way because external USB devices work with the
# 'block-mount' package within OpenWRT
